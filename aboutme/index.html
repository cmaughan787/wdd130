<h1>Clara Maughan</h1>
<p>I love hiking, being outdoors in general, and spending time with family and friends! I previously studied accounting and worked as an accounts payable intern which lead me to realize I needed to chnage my major. I am studying computer science and hope to be able to help develop financial systems.</p>
